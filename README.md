# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Description
A Readme maker. This code allows the user to run 'node index.js' in the command line and recieve a list or questions that once answered will create a readme file. 

The code uses the 'generateMarkdown.js' file to build an outline of the readme and then fills that in using material inputed by the user.
